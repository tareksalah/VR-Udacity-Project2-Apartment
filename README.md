VR Nanodegree Course 2 Project
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name: Tarek Salah Kamel
Time: 16:00 hours
1 thing I liked: Desiging the Appartment and Making the Globe Rotate
1 thing was challenging: Adjusting the Lighting of the Scene

Google VR SDK version: From this link https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/releases/tag/v1.0.3  ... GVR Unity SDK v1.0.3

LightMap Settings:
 - The more I increased the baking resolution, I got brighter effects of light sources in the scene with clear sudden changes from less bright areas to more bright areas.
